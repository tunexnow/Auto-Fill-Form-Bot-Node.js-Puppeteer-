A simple and powerful automation bot that fills and submits web forms automatically using Node.js and Puppeteer.
This bot types text with a human-like delay, selects dropdowns, checks checkboxes, clicks the submit button, and saves screenshots before and after the automation.

This project includes a ready-made demo form (demo_form.html) and a fully configurable automation setup via fields.json and values.json.
